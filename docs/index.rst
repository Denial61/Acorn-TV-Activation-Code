Acorn TV offers an incredible selection of British, Irish, and international dramas, mysteries, and comedies. If you're trying to stream content on a smart TV or streaming device, you’ll likely need an Acorn TV activation code to get started. This code connects your device to your existing Acorn TV account and gives you full access to the service.

Whether you’re using Roku, Amazon Fire Stick, Apple TV, or a Smart TV, the activation process is simple once you understand how it works. This guide explains everything about finding, using, and troubleshooting your Acorn TV activation code.

What Is an Acorn TV Activation Code?

The Acorn TV activation code is a unique combination of letters or numbers that appears on your screen when you install the Acorn TV app on certain streaming devices. This code is required to link the device to your Acorn TV account.

Unlike signing in with your email and password, which is common on computers and mobile apps, smart TVs and streaming boxes often use this code system to make login easier and quicker.

Where to Find the Acorn TV Activation Code

To get your activation code, download and open the Acorn TV app on your streaming device or smart TV. Once the app launches, you will see a prompt asking you to activate the device. Along with this message, you’ll see a code and a web address, usually acorn.tv/activate.

This code is what you will use to sync your account to your device.

How to Use the Acorn TV Activation Code

After seeing the code on your device, go to acorn.tv/activate using a browser on your phone, tablet, or computer. Make sure you’re already signed in to your Acorn TV account on that browser. If you’re not, the site will ask you to sign in first.

Once logged in, enter the activation code exactly as shown on your device screen. The page will confirm when your code has been accepted, and within seconds, your TV or streaming device will refresh to load the full Acorn TV interface.

Now you’re ready to watch any show or film in Acorn TV’s catalog directly from your television.

If Your Activation Code Doesn’t Work

Sometimes, the Acorn TV activation code may not work the first time. Here are a few tips to help:

Double-check the code for typing errors or expired digits
Make sure you entered the code quickly, as it may expire after a few minutes
Reload the Acorn TV app to generate a new code if needed
Clear your browser cookies if the activation page doesn't respond

If none of these steps work, uninstall and reinstall the Acorn TV app, or try activating the device from another browser or device. If you still experience problems, Acorn TV customer support can provide personalized assistance.

Do You Need an Account Before Activating?

Yes, you must have an active Acorn TV subscription before you can use an activation code. If you haven’t signed up yet, go to the official Acorn TV website and choose the Start Free Trial option. Create your account by entering your email and setting a password, then choose a subscription plan and payment method.

Once your account is created, you can return to your smart TV or streaming device and begin the activation process.

Supported Devices for Acorn TV Activation Code

The Acorn TV activation code is primarily used on platforms that don’t have built-in keyboard login capabilities or where inputting long email addresses can be inconvenient. Devices where you’ll commonly see the activation code include:

Roku
Amazon Fire TV
Apple TV
Smart TVs like Samsung and LG
Android TV boxes

For mobile apps and web browsers, you typically sign in directly with your email and password without needing an activation code.

Can You Use the Same Activation Code More Than Once?

Each activation code is unique and can be used only once. If you log out of the Acorn TV app or uninstall it, you’ll receive a new code the next time you try to activate it. Reuse of the same code on another device is not possible.

If you’re setting up Acorn TV on multiple devices, you’ll need to go through the activation process separately for each one, entering a different code each time.
